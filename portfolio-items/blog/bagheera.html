            <div class="text-area">Bagheera was a Tortoiseshell cat that I met when living in a rented flat in Sheffield. We didn't buy her, but she came round to see us everyday from the moment we moved in.
                We started feeding her pretty quickly (she never left to go elsewhere for food) and she soon started sleeping in bed with me too!
                She was very cute, a little sassy and loved cuddles. Easily the most affectionate cat I've ever met.

            <div class="text-area">
                She slept a lot and I think she enjoyed that I worked from home, as it meant there was always a warm lap for her to sleep in.
                We were always accidently giving her too much food as she would always meow at us for it and would eat it even if she had already eaten.
                A couple times she even made herself sick from eating too much! She was a very vocal cat, you always knew where she was.

                Prior to meeting Bagheera, the only cat I had met was when I was 10. I went to stroke it and he bit me on the finger, drawing blood.
                From that moment on, I wasn't fond of cats. Bagheera changed my mind. I used to wake up to her lying on my chest, with a paw on my cheek.
                I could feel and hear her purr. It was a lovely way to start the day and I miss her dearly.
