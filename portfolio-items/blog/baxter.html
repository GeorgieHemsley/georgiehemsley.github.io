            <div class="text-area">Baxter is an English Bulldog I used to live with when I shared a flat in Kelham Island. He was 5 years old.
                He loved to pick up plastic bottles on walks (you can see one of his finds in the photo above!), which he would carry until you go to a bin so you could throw it away.
                Even though he loved to recycle, he was possibly the laziest dog I've come across.
                Everytime you try to take him for a walk, he would lie on the floor so you couldn't put his harness on!
            </div>
            <div class="text-area">
                Here Baxter is sat on the garden sofa next to me, whilst I have a coffee and read my book. He wasn't very happy to have had to leave the house

            <div class="text-area">
                Baxter liked to splay out under tables when I took him to pub gardens. His back legs always look like little chicken legs!
                For this reason, I often called him my little chicken. He didn't seem to mind...

            <div class="text-area">
                    He's much happier when he gets to bask in the sun.
                    Always very happy to see people or accompany me to the coffee shop whilst I read my books, he was famous in the local area. Everyone remembered Baxter.
                    He loved his food, was a little chubby and had an adorable underbite. You could forever see his little teefs!
